# Preview Explanation
In this preview I am playing my ominous background music over a few spliced news clips. This is just the start of what this section will become. Eventually it will start out with news reports sprinkled over the music and then eventually they will become more frequent and overlap in a chaotic manor. This is technically a portion of my soundscape that doesn't occur until well into the piece, but it is one that required no physical recording to draft so I thought it was a good place to start. I also tried adding some distortion to the music to make it sound as if it was coming from an old radio or tv set, with crackles here and there. You should feel calm at first and you won't feel different for this preview because the bulk is only the three voice clips, but eventually the stres wll build as more intense news trickes in.
