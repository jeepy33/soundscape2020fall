For the last edits to my soundscape I looked to my peer reviews to make edits. The suggestions included editing the music to cover more empty space, and adding more news clips to add to the last segemnt, keeping the logical progression of increasing the intensity. I went ahead and stretched the music and moved sound effects around to fill any empty white space. I added multiple news clips from cbs and msnbc to the terminal part.
