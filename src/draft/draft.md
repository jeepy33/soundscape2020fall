# Draft Changes
I added all the news articles in, as well as modulated the background music. Added coughing and ekg monitor noises. Overall just actually composed the piece considering it was like two clips for the preview.

## Soundscape Overview
- The alarm clock and shower sounds represent the start of a day in quarantine
- The distopian 40's music is to set the tone/atmosphere
- The keyboard/mouse/zoom sounds are to place the listener at a computer
- The news reports get gradualy more frequent and worse as the days repeat
- Coughing begins and gets worse as the piece progresses
- An ekg heart monitor occasionally beeps throughout the whole thing getting faster as the piece nears it's end
- All of these layers and the repeating of sounds (with slight distortions) is supposed to give the illusion of repetetive days where time feels distorted and the state of our world is collapsing.
